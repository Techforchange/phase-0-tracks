# Git Definitions NOTTT

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Version control allows for the developers to see the history of its codes and bring information from files into one. Developers use it so that they can backtrack if needed when the system has a bug, they can review their history or they use this information to determine answers they may have. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one? ? It is a copy of the file you are currently working on allowing you to make changes independently and then merge it back to the original file. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit allows you to record any changes made within your code. It is best to commit and check its status often. A good commit is one that is staged and given details.
* What is a merge conflict? Merge conflict is when you accidentally merge another branch into the branch you are currently working on.
