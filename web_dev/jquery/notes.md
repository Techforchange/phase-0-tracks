My plan to learn jQuery:
*Go on LaunchSchool site to read what they have
*Spend some time on Codeacademy
* Go on W3 Schools

Best strategies:
-Googling: Which sites are the best to learn JQuery?
-Skimming through the page first to see if it fits my learning style and if it has videos
-Starting with Jquery for dummies helps because it breaks down the hard concepts and then I was able to use further sites to further deepen my knowledge
