What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
 It never assumes that the user is incompetent. It always assumes you know what you are doing and allows you do do anything you tell it to. Anything. Whether it is unintentionally bad or not. That is a huge amount of power in the hands of a user.  Linux treats everyone equally and allows everyone the maximum amount of power. That is egalitarian. Other operating systems are elitist and exclusive because they withhold or hide their power behind an inflexible Graphical User Interface that allows one to do only what the developers think we should be allowed to do.

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
VPS is your own server that belongs 100% to you where you control it without being affected by other servers for more security. The advantages are simply the security and control one has over the server.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
If ran as root, it might have freedom to delete everything in the system. You're more prone to bugs and mistakes.
